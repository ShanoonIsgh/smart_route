PRODUCT

  To begin with ,this group is making a traffic signaling system that inform drivers about route that are on the move and routes that are at halts.
This project is aimed at informing drivers about the various routes they take so that ,they can make choices to avoid conjestion on the roads.For instance,for ambulances to skip traffic to get to the hospital which can also save lives.

  We are going to use programming language such as: Python,HTML,BOOTSTRAP. And technology such as GPIO,FLASK,HEROKU, and more.

PLANNING

  To add up,we are going to access the strenght of each individual in the group and assign task that we can quickly and easily work on.
We plan to make  use of the lecture time that is; beginning early in the morning at 9 am, take lunch at 12noon to 1pm and continue to 4pm .That is to say,the same routine will be repeated for the next 4 days.

  Meanwhile,we will keep track of our progress by using the trello platform to work on each task as we progress through it.  
We will again,support each other by having discussions about the project and finding solutions to problems each member finds .
Before this,we will be using stackoverflow,google,youtube as sources of research and resource environment.

  In a nut shell,we will need the assistance of our very intelligent lecturers.
